# Reverse It #7

**Description**: Create a brand new console project that takes a sequence of numbers/characters and reverses them. The user will be prompted to enter a number/string. Will display the original int/string before being reversed. Will have validation. Will not use built in methods.

**Comments**: Your code is well made. I noticed you used a .Lower() method, it seems very practical.
I tried it out a few times to attempt to break it, but I couldn't, so I think the code is solid. Great work :+1:
